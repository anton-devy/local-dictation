"""Microphone recording into a 16kHz mono float32 buffer for Whisper.

The input stream is opened only for the duration of an actual recording and fully closed
(not merely paused) between recordings, so the microphone is never active while the app is
idle. (v2 originally kept the stream continuously open to support a pre-roll buffer, but
that meant the mic-in-use indicator stayed on for the app's entire runtime -- a real privacy
problem. Pre-roll is fundamentally incompatible with a cold mic, so it was removed rather
than tuned; the resulting stream-startup latency at the start of each recording is an
accepted, unmitigated trade-off.) A recording window is also capped at a maximum duration so
a forgotten toggle doesn't record indefinitely.
